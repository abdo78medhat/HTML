        <h2>Romantic</h2>
        <h3>Ugly Love</h3>
        <p>When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she knows it isn’t love at first sight.
             They wouldn’t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. 
             The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open,
              they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex.
             Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.</p>

            <h3>Red, White & Royal Blue</h3>
            <p>First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz is the closest thing to a prince this side of the Atlantic. With his intrepid sister and the Veep’s genius granddaughter, they’re the White House Trio, a beautiful millennial marketing strategy for his mother, President Ellen Claremont. International socialite duties do have downsides—namely, when photos of a confrontation with his longtime nemesis Prince Henry at a royal wedding leak to the tabloids and threaten American/British relations. The plan for damage control: staging a fake friendship between the First Son and the Prince.

            <h3>Kindly Inquisitors</h3>
            <p>“A liberal society stands on the proposition that we should all take seriously the idea that we might be wrong. This means we must place no one, including ourselves, beyond the reach of criticism; it means that we must allow people to err, even where the error offends and upsets, as it often will.” So writes Jonathan Rauch in Kindly Inquisitors, which has challenged readers for more than twenty years with its bracing and provocative exploration of the issues surrounding attempts to limit free speech.</p>
